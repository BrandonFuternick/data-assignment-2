    <p>Data collected by the New York City Parks Department has revealed that social distancing violations within parks facilities have gone largely ignored by patrons and staff alike during the coronavirus pandemic. The data, collected between
      March and October of this year, shows that during the height of the pandemic, park staff often did not approach crowds to enforce distancing guidelines. On occasions when staff did approach these groups, they rarely complied with instructions
      and remained within an unsafe distance from each other. At the time of reporting, the NYC Parks Department had not responded to a request to clarify why data collected in July through October was significantly lower than the earlier months.</p>

      <script type="text/javascript">
        ! function() {
          "use strict";
          window.addEventListener("message", (function(a) {
            if (void 0 !== a.data["datawrapper-height"])
              for (var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]) {
                var t = document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-" + e) || document.querySelector("iframe[src*='" + e + "']");
                t && (t.style.height = a.data["datawrapper-height"][e] + "px")
              }
          }))
        }();
      </script>
    </div>

    <p> This trend goes against guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) instructing people to stay at least 6 feet from others outside of their households when out in public in order to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
      Though
      outdoor spaces have proven to be safer than indoor ones, keeping a safe distance has still been recommended to ensure that the virus would not be transmitted by anyone who may be infected.
