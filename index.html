    <p>During the height of the coronavirus pandemic in New York City, the Parks Department took an ‘all-hands on deck’ approach to monitoring and enforcing social distancing violations. According to Dan Kastanis, Press Officer for NYC Parks, social
      distancing monitoring was handled largely by Parks Enforcement Patrol Officers and Urban Park Rangers, who were supported by Maintenance and Operations staff as needed.<br><br>

      Data collected between March and October of this year by the NYC Parks Department showed instances of social distancing violations noted by Maintenance and Operations (M&O) staff in the course of attending to their green space maintenance
      duties. M&O staff were directed to log violations to refer to the appropriate staff to handle, but were not required to approach the crowds themselves. Kastanis noted that a drop-off in the collected data in July was due to a phasing out of the
      M&O social distance monitoring when NYC’s infection rates decreased significantly in that month.</p>

    <p> Guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) instructs people to stay at least 6 feet from others outside of their households when out in public in order to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus.
      Though
      outdoor spaces have proven to be safer than indoor ones, keeping a safe distance has still been recommended to ensure that the virus would not be transmitted by anyone who may be infected.
